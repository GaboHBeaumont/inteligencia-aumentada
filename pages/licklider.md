## Psicólogo e Ingeniero Informático, nacido en 1915 en San Luis, Missouri,
## Fue un visionario de la computación interactiva, un pionero de internet con una vision de lo que hoy es
## Licklider was instrumental in conceiving, funding and managing the research that led to modern personal computers and the Internet. In 1960 his seminal paper on "Man-Computer Symbiosis"[28] foreshadowed interactive computing, and he went on to fund early efforts in time-sharing and application development, most notably the work of Douglas Engelbart, who founded the Augmentation Research Center at Stanford Research Institute and created the famous On-Line System where the computer mouse was invented.
